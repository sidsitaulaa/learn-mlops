# 1.3 Types of Shift in Machine Learning

Various types of shifts must be kep in mind for a ML model in production. These includes:
1. **Concept Shift:** In this type of shift, the primary mapping of input to output that model is responsible for changes.  
2. **Data Shift:** This involves change in the input data which ultimately makes the need for new dataset or reformed dataset.
