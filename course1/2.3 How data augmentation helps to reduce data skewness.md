Augmentation is the process of creating more dataset using existing dataset by modifying the data slightly. For example, adding noise overlay on top of existing sound dataset. Augmentation is useful in cases where a particular data class is low in volume.

A point to be noted is that augmentation is usually done in the cases od unsupervised learning and the class of data what must be augmented is selected by understand the need of the project.
