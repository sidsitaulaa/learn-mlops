# Model-centric Development vs Data-centric Development
An AI project can be usually approached in two different ways:
1. **Model-Centric Development:** In this approach, the key focus of the AI project is algorithm/code/model. It is usually used when the dataset is standard and fixed. The most common example is the AI projects used in research papers where the data is fairly standardized and consistent.
2. **Data-Centric Development:** In this approach, the key focus of the AI project is continous improvement of data. It is usually used in business focused AI projects where we use the already available and opensource models but the dataset is different.
