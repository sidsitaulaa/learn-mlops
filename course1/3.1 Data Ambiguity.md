# Data ambiguity in annotations


When annotating data, various people are invovled. Based on their experience, they might tend to annotate data quite differently. 
For examle "Umm, Im not sure" can also be annotated as "Umm...I'm not sure". These ambiguity are caused mainly due to lack of clear annotation guidelines. To reduce such ambiguity, we can agree on a particular annotation and use that as a standard for all our datasets. 

Data ambiguity must me removed as soon as posibble as it can negatively affect the Human Level Performance(HLP) for a task.
