# Machine Learning Project Lifecycle

The lifecycle of typical ML project consists of following phases:
1. **Scoping** ðŸ‘‰ Deciding what to work on, the role of ML in the project.
2. **Define Data and Establish Basemark** ðŸ‘‰ Decide about the type of data to work with.
3. **Label and Organize the Data** ðŸ‘‰ Consistently label the data to yeild best quality of data.
4. **Select and Train the Model** ðŸ‘‰ Select the model to work with(eg, pretrained models, decision trees, random forest, GANs or any other type  of model based on the project need).
5. **Perform Error Analysis** ðŸ‘‰ Evaluate the performance of models which will help us to finetune the model.
6. **Deploy in Production** ðŸ‘‰ Deploy the valdiated model to the production server to evaluate its real time performance.
8. **Monitor and Maintain the System** ðŸ‘‰ Monitor the model for any anamoly in the system and evolve the system throughout time
