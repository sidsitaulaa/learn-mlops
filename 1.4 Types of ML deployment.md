# Types of Machine Learning Deployment

The following main deployment types exists in MLOps:
1. **Shadow:** A model is run in production but the output of the model has no significance besides evaluating the model.
2. **Canary Deployment:** This is a progressive rollout of a model is done which involves division of traffic to new and old models.
3. **Blue Green Deployment:** In this deployment, two different yet identical environments are made. One environment(blue) runs the current version of the model and another environment(green) runs the newer version of the model. The traffic between the environment is controlled with the help of a router.
