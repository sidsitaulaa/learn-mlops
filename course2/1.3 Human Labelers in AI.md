In many cases, humans have always been the source of data for AI systems. Human sources of data can be divided into three different categories:

1. **General Labelers ðŸ‘‰** These human labelers are mostly found in the crowdsourced platforms. They label the data manually by using various data annotation tools. Mostly used for tasks where no domain specicific knowledge is required like transcribing.
2. **Experts ðŸ‘‰** They are the domain experts who are usually tasked for labelling the data when domain expertiese is needed. They are expensive to hire and are used mostly in academic research.
3. **User data ðŸ‘‰** It includes data that are geenrated by the user of your AI system.
