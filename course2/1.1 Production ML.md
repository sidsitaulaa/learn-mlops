# Why Software engineering concepts are important for MLOps 

While building a model in local environment focuses only on the model and data, production ML systems are quite different. In production, the ML system does not only depend on the model and data, it depends on various other factors like:

1. **Deployment pipelines**
2. **Data pipelines**
3. **Server infrastucture**
4. **Runtime environment of models**
5. **Making endpoints for the deployed ML model for inference**
6. **Integration of ML model** 

These factors are the part of software engineering discipline and are needed for successful implementation of ML models in production. So, we can certainly infer that software enginnering concepts are important for MLOps.
