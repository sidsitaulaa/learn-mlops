# Responsible Data Collection
In most of the use case of AI systems, user data is heavily involved and when this happens you must keep the mantra of responsilbe data collection in mind.

Broadly speaking, responsible data collection includes three pillars:

1. **Data SecurityðŸ‘‰** It refers to proper and secure collection of user data and storing it securely so that user data is not compromised.
2. **PrivacyðŸ‘‰** It refers to respecting privacy of user data. For example, deleting data when user requests, storing onyl necessary data etc.
3. **FairnessðŸ‘‰** It refers to reducing any baisness that might occur in the data. AI models learning sterotypes from data is an example of violation of this principle.
