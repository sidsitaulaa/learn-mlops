A pipeline refers to the various stages that our input data does through to give output. A typical AI model in production can go through various pipeline stages. 
This particular flow of data through pipeline raises the need for tracking two important information of data to make the debugging of the models easier:
1. **Provenance:** This refers to the source of input data Xi for a particular pipeline stage.
2. **Lineage:** This refers to the series of pipeline operations the data has previously gone through.
