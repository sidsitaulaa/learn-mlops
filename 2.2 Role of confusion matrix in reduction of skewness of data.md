# Role of confusion matrix in reduction of skewness of data

Skewness of data refers to the uneven distribution of a data. For example, imagine a dataset containing classification of a disease. This dataset can contain 99% of data which invoves positive case and 1% that has negative cases. In such case, there is clear skewness as predicting that all the data has disease results in 99% accuracy. 

A confusion matrix can help us to reduce such skewness of a data. It does this by helping us calculate:
a. **Precision ðŸ‘‰** Ratio that indicates the number of true positive cases out of all predicted positive cases
b. **Recall ðŸ‘‰** Ratio of positive cases that is correctly identified.
c. **F1-score ðŸ‘‰** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall


By using the above metrics and improving the models based on the above metrics will help us to tackle the problem of skewness of the data as these metrics becomes quite low when there is skewness in the data.
