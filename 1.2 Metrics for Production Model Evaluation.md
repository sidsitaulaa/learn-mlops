# Metrics for Production Model Evaluation

Various types of metrics are considered for evaluation a ML model in production. These includes:
1. **Software metrics:** This involves characterstrics of the software environment on which the model is currently running. For example: latency, throughput, bandwidthm server load etc.
2. **Input Metrics:** This involves selected attributes related to the data. For example: num of missing values, average of certain data attribute etc.
3. **Output metrics:** This involves analysis of the output obtained. For example: number of times null is returned etc.
